# ATSum
The code for ACL2020 paper "[Attend, Translate and Summarize: An Efficient Method for Neural Cross-Lingual Summarization](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.121.pdf)"

# Requirement
* pytorch >= 1.0
* python >= 3.6

# Dataset
The datasets used in this paper can be found [here](https://github.com/ZNLP/NCLS-Corpora).

# How to run?
1. You should first obtain the word alignment by the [fastalign](https://github.com/clab/fast_align) tool. There is an example in "ATS-NE/beaver/data/savefile/c2e.pkl".

2. Build vocab
```python
cd ATS-NE/tools && python build_vocab $number < $textfile > $vocab_file
```
3. Build the translation candidates and their index.
```python
cd .. && python -m beaver.data.post_prob
```
4. Start training
```python
python train.py -config run_config/train.json
```
5. Start decoding
```python
python translate.py -config run_config/decode.json
```

# Generated summaries and their scores
The summaries generated by our methods as well as their ROUGE score and [MoverScore](https://github.com/AIPHES/emnlp19-moverscore) are presented in "resultofpaper" folder. The scripts we use to obtain rouge scores and MoverScore are also included.
